# Exploring the relationship between sex, age and aneurysm occurrence                                               

This project utilises Python to clean and analyse an aneurysm dataset, leveraging Pandas for data processing and exploratory data analysis, and Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh for dynamic data visualisation. The key research questions include:

1. Is there a significant difference in aneurysm occurrence between sexes?
2. How does age influence the occurrence of aneurysms?
3. What structural and hemodynamic features are most associated with age and sex?

This project aims to explore the relationship between aneurysm occurrence, sex, and age. The key research questions include:

Is there a significant difference in aneurysm occurrence between sexes?
How does age influence the occurrence of aneurysms?
What structural and hemodynamic features are most associated with age and sex?




Age Distribution By Sex

Interestingly, 63% of the participants are female, suggesting that aneurysms are 13% more prevalent in women. A closer examination of the age distribution reveals that females experience aneurysms across a broader age range compared to males. This indicates that both younger and older women are more likely to suffer from aneurysms than their male counterparts.

                

Location of Aneurysm Occurrence

Most aneurysm locations exhibit a fairly even distribution between males and females. However, Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) aneurysms are predominantly found in females, accounting for 60% of their cases. In contrast, the most prominent location for males is the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA), with 37% of their cases.

                    




When focusing on age, Basilar artery aneurysms exhibit a significant age disparity between sex’s. They mostly affect older males, with a mean age of 63, whereas females have a notably lower mean age of 47. Overall, the graph reveals a broader age distribution for females, while males are predominantly in the older age range.







Prevalence of Aneurysm Type

Males exhibit a higher prevalence of Terminal Aneurysms, with 84.2% of male participants exhibiting this type of aneurysm. Females show an even distribution of aneurysm type.

For females, the mean age for experiencing lateral aneurysms is 55, compared to 52 for terminal aneurysms. Conversely, males have a mean age of 58 for lateral aneurysms and 55 for terminal aneurysms. Notably, females tend to be younger than males when experiencing these aneurysms.




Conclusion

The results of this project highlight distinct differences in aneurysm occurrence between sexes, revealing significant trends based on age, aneurysm location, and vascular features.




Females are more likely to experience aneurysms at a younger age and show a higher prevalence of Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) aneurysms, whereas males are more prone to terminal aneurysms at older ages. These findings suggest that vascular structure and haemodynamics may contribute to the observed sex differences. Notably, females tend to exhibit greater vessel torsion and curvature, which could be linked to earlier aneurysm onset and more complex aneurysm types. Meanwhile, males generally present smaller vessel angles, potentially complicating treatment options.

Further research is needed to explore the underlying causes of these differences, particularly the impact of torsion and curvature on aneurysm development and location, and how these factors may influence sex-specific treatment strategies. Understanding these structural and haemodynamic disparities can provide valuable insights for improving diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for both men and women.
